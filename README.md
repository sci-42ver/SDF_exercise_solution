# SDF_exercise_solution
exercise solution for Software Design for Flexibility (SDF)

## other sdf solutions (by "Software Design for Flexibility exercise solution github")
"Software Design for Flexibility exercise solution" and "Software Design for Flexibility exercise solution gitlab" (almost nothing related) or "... github" both doesn't have more related links with exercises.
- partial
  [This](https://github.com/nbardiuk/software-design-for-flexibility) is one repo with solutions to some exercises although too *less*.
  [This](https://github.com/mbillingr/sdf) has partial solutions by [this search](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ambillingr%2Fsdf%20parallel-combine&type=code) although without appropriate tests.
  - [This](https://github.com/chebert/software-design-for-flexibility) ~~I *can't find the relation* with the exercises~~ gives partial solution in *Racket* based on chapter.
    ~~ https://github.com/chebert/software-design-for-flexibility/blob/5eacde59855888180482031b9ee27c7c7b6cf4d1/sdf-function-combinators.rkt#L110-L111 implies it *doesn't solve the exercise* at all.~~
    - ~~Since it uses something like `arity-at-least?`, it will take unnecessary time to check Racket doc. So I won't read this implementation except when I am really stuck at something.~~
  - [~~this~~](https://github.com/jeffhhk/SoftwareDesignForFlexibility) has *no* solutions as README says.
- See [this with annotations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oyk2EHiTfSe1t0Wbr-HJtfVVvLvulonckpOWaD5KD3E/edit) from [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1daYgzQX6Wuxy-iEA9jqpu8b50a_Zbd0FxvKswxAV478/edit)
  [summary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vs9ep6A9VLvtn6QLMalYgxQSMXvfPdZA0vdVT6POoJs/edit#)
  - The above seems to have no solutions for Assignment by searching "Assignment".
  - I [can't join its slack](https://compositional-cb63110.slack.com/) room and this course has finished
### different languages
- ~~[this having ~~the most~~ partial solutions although with full chapter dir's ...](https://github.com/compclub/exercises/blob/main/chapter-2-dsl/rmoehn/README.md) uses Clojure~~

    > I'm not completing most of the exercises, since I assume the initial thinking about the solution is the most valuable part for me.
    Weird man. So
    > so I might end up *fooling myself*.
- [~~this~~](https://github.com/compclub/projects) uses *Rust*...
- ~~https://github.com/bishwa-poudel/Software-Design-and-Architecture-Specialization-Coursera~~ weirdly use Java.
# nbardiuk solution comment
## 2.1
- > ; (assert (= 2 (get-arity h))) this is too naive - does not allow to use 'list
  Not. Since if this holds, then `(assert (= 1 f-arity))` also doesn't work.
## 2.2
- `(guarantee-procedure-of-arity h (make-procedure-arity 2) 'h)` implies `h` can have more than 2 arguments.

## 2.1
- `call-with-values`
  > the continuation expects to receive the same number of *values* that procedure accepts as *arguments*.
  > Thunk must return multiple values using the values procedure. Then procedure is called with the multiple values as its arguments. The result yielded by procedure is returned as the result of call-with-values
  This implies `compose`.
  > Thunk is invoked with a continuation that expects to receive multiple values;
  i.e. what it does will "receive multiple values" as `(apply g args)` implies. See https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Continuations.html
- TODO
  ['"multiple-value" continuation'](https://www.reddit.com/r/scheme/comments/zdp1b5/srfi_244_multiplevalue_definitions/)
## 2.2
The following is more general than mine since it allow the case where f has variable argument number and g has the fixed argument number.
```scheme
    (assert (or (fixed-arity? arity-f)
                (fixed-arity? arity-g)))
```
# chebert solution comment
## 2.1 (See code comments in this repo)
## 2.2
- `combine-arities` is a bit different due to `arity-list`.
