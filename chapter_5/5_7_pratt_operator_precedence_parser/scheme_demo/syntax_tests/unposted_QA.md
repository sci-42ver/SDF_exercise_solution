IMHO hkbst's answer doesn't say about the difference between "bound identifier" and "free identifier" which is where OP's question originates from.

The reference book in [this QA answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33368472/21294350) is very helpful. We can search for "free identifier" in its index which shows only:

> free identifier occurrence, 59, 65, 645

We can also search for the general "identifier":

```
identifier, 4, 46
  bound occurrence, 65
  escaped, 515
  free occurrence, 59, 65, 645
```

Based on p59, "free identifier occurrence" just means "free identifier".

> These undefined identifiers
are called free identifiers.

It also shows in p65~66:

> An identifier occurrence X is bound with respect to a statement 〈s〉
if it is declared inside 〈s〉, i.e., in a local statement, in the pattern of a case
statement, or as *argument of a procedure declaration*. An identifier occurrence
that is not bound is free. 

> A bound identifier occurrence does not
exist at run time; it is a textual variable name that *tex-tually occurs inside a construct that declares it* (e.g., a
procedure or variable declaration)

So `x` in the above examples are all "free identifiers" because for the *mere* `syntax-rules` it doesn't define about `x`. It refer to `(define x 42)` because "the instance of syntax-rules appears" in its scope (i.e. top-level).

For an example for "bound identifier", R7RS gives one good example:
> As an example, if let and cond are defined as in section 7.3 then they are hygienic (as required) and the following is not an error.
> ```scheme
> (let ((=> #f))
>   (cond (#t => 'ok)))            ⟹ ok 
> ```
> The macro transformer for cond recognizes => as a local variable, and hence an expression, and not as the base identifier =>, which the macro transformer treats as a syntactic keyword. Thus the example expands into
> ```scheme
> (let ((=> #f))
>   (if #t (begin => 'ok))) 
> ```
> instead of
> ```scheme
> (let ((=> #f))
>   (let ((temp #t))
>     (if temp ('ok temp)))) 
> ```
> which would result in an invalid procedure call.

As the above says, here `=>` is bound in `let`

p.s. "escaped variable identifier" in p506 is just like escaped character in Bash where the character has one *special* meaning when following the escape character `\`. (see p51 for "Variable identifier" definition which is different from Atom definition in p53.)
> For example:
> ```
> meth !A(bar:X)
> % Method body
> end
> ```
> causes the method label to be *whatever the variable A was bound to*.
