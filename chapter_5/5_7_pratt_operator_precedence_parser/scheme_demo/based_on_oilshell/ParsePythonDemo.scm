    ;; 0.a.1. IGNORE Notice these 2 are not compatible in some way at least for list_display which allows assignment_expression while the latter only has "assignment_expression" for genexps or args.
    ;; The latter has "list: '[' [star_named_expressions] ']'"
    ;; The former has "list_display ::= "[" [flexible_expression_list | ...] "]""
    ;; star_named_expression in the latter means similar to flexible_expression
    ;; where starred_expression < "'*' bitwise_or" plus "expression !':='".
    ;; Actually "[lambda n: n]" is fine, so use the latter link although I have used the former for all the above...
    ;; 0.a.1.0. The latter has
    ;; > star_named_expression:
    ;; > | '*' bitwise_or 
    ;; > | named_expression
    ;; > 
    ;; > named_expression:
    ;; > | assignment_expression
    ;; > | expression !':='
    ;; so it adds "named_expression".
    ;; 0.a.2. Here I skipped generator_expression/genexp (probably similar. I won't dig into the routine comparison.)
    ;; and also yield_atom/group-yield_expr-part.
    ;; Anyway they are just some specific syntaxes without introducing new parsing techniques.
    ;; 0.a.2.a. I have implemented parenth_form/group-named_expression-part.
    ;; SO in summary, consume-possible-elems-implicitly-and-the-ending-token in NullParen
    ;; should use named_expression-sentinel for ([...:=]elm) part (parenth_form)
    ;; while use star_named_expression's one for ()/(elm,)/(elm,...[,]) parts (* part is skipped due to similarity with "not").
    ;; 1. Comparison see NullParen
    ;;;; TODO tests

    ;;;; BEHAVIOR for list
    ;; Here I will still use https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#list-displays as the main reference
    ;; because it is more descriptive although the latter one is more exact.
    ;; As the above implies, list_display (list display) means (list | listcomp) in the latter although has less support.
    ;; IGNORE By searching '"["', this is the mere expr about list.
    ;; 0. > list: '[' [star_named_expressions] ']'
    ;; Similar to tuple but allows [arg] to be one list.
    ;; 1. Again "listcomp" is skipped.

    ;; just same as list but with the different delimeters.
